opbb10
======

Thank you for downloading Hookflash's Open Peer BlackBerry 10 SDK (QNX based) - Beta.

These are instructions for building the OpenPeer shared library for Blackberry. This assumes Mac (and probably works on Linux) but issues may come up on Windows.

## Download the NDK ##
- The IDE, compliers, etc for Blackberry can be downloaded from http://developer.blackberry.com/native/download/.
- The simulator can also be downloaded but we have had poor success with it. Far better to have a real device.

## Clone Libraries ##
Currently you need two projects "op" and "opbb10". "op" is using the 20121212-json-provisioning (temporarily) and "opbb10" is using master. Both must be located at the same directory level. Clone the repos as follows:
- git clone git@github.com:openpeer/opbb10.git
- git clone git@github.com:openpeer/op-old.git op -b 20121212-json-provisioning

## Building Boost ##
There is a special version of boost that was built by Blackberry. It is found in the OP github repository: https://github.com/openpeer/opbb10.
Building is done from the command line. Instructions for building the library are found on the github page: https://github.com/blackberry/Boost. Search for "Build Instructions". Or, try the following (assuming Mac and the NDK is installed in Applications)

    source /Applications/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh
    cd opbb10/hookflash-libs/boost/rim-build
    ./build.sh install static

The HF libraries (core, stack, service) will be looking for this in the op/hookflash-libs/bbBoost directory, which should exist as symbolic links if you cloned the repo from github.
If they do not for any reason, you will need to create a symbolic link in a shell and linking using...
    
    ln -s opbb10/hookflash-libs/boost/ op/hookflash-libs/bbBoost

## PCRE - the regular expression library for BB ##
Boost regular expressions crash on the Blackberry. Instead of trying to fix the crash the PCRE regular expression library was added ot the opbb10 branch. This needs to be built.
Type the following commands (assuming Mac and the NDK is installed in Applications)

    source /Applications/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh
    cd opbb10/hookflash-libs/pcre/PCRE/qnx
    make

Note that the library needs to have a symbolic link too just like bbBoost added (unless cloned from github in which case it should already exist).
    
    ln -s opbb10/hookflash-libs/pcre/ op/hookflash-libs/pcre

## Adding libraries to the .BAR file ##
The .bar file is a zip file (renamed to .bar) that contains the files and directory structure of the application. Note that libraries are added via the .pro file (Cascades does things differently from native BB). But adding it to the pro does not add it to the BAR file.
Shared objects (aka libraries) are added via the bar-descriptor.xml file. Opening it in the IDE will bring up a UI. In the assets tab add the .so.

## Launching IDE ##
Go to Launch Pad -> bbndk (other) -> qde
Load the workspace: op/hookflash-core/projects/bb

## Import OP projects ##
Select Import from Momentics IDE
Import following projects from "op/hookflash-core/projects/bb":
  - bbcryptopp
  - bbhfcore
  - bbhfservices
  - bbhfstack
  - bbudns
  - bbzsLib
  - common_audio
  - common_video
  - modules
  - system_wrappers
  - video_engine
  - voice_engine
  - vpx
  - yuv

## Import OPBB10 sample app ##
Select Import from Momentics IDE
Import following project from "opbb10/samples/":
  - opbbcsampleapp

## Building the sample application ##
Select Device-Debug configuration for all projects in workspace
Build only OP projects
Build Sample app project

*Please note that OP projects MUST be built before sample application, in order to link correctly 

## Running the sample application ##
Select Run/Debug from Momentics IDE and run your application on the BB10 device
